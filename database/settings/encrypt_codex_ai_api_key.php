 * Encrypts an AI key that an earlier release wrote in plain text.
 *
 * lin-codex 0.4.3 and earlier accepted spatie/laravel-settings 3.7.0 and
 * 3.7.1, which do not know the ShouldBeEncrypted attribute, so a key saved
 * through CodexAiSettings on one of them landed in settings.payload as it
 * was typed. A payload that decrypts is left byte for byte as it is, which
 * makes the migration safe on every install and safe to run more than
 * once; a payload that does not decrypt is taken to be that plain-text key
 * and encrypted in place. The settings cache is cleared afterwards: a
 * cached copy of the old row would fail to decrypt on the next read.
